# 🚀 DSA Repository - Your Guide to Crushing Data Structures & Algorithms 🧠💻

Welcome to the **ultimate** DSA cheat code! This repository is your one-stop-shop for learning, practicing, and mastering Data Structures and Algorithms. Whether you're prepping for interviews, improving your problem-solving skills, or just geeking out, we've got you covered. 💪

## 🌟 What's Inside?

- **Arrays**: Basics to advanced, multi-dimensional, and all that jazz.
- **Linked Lists**: Single, double, circular – you name it!
- **Stacks & Queues**: The building blocks for tons of algorithms.
- **Trees & Graphs**: Get ready to traverse! 🌲📊
- **Sorting & Searching**: Binary search, quicksort, mergesort – speed up your game.
- **Dynamic Programming**: The magic of solving subproblems like a pro. 🔮
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Sometimes, being greedy *is* the answer. 😏
- **Backtracking**: Find all the solutions, not just the first one!
